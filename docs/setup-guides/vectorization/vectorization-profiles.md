# Managing vectorization profiles

The FoundationaLLM (FLLM) vectorization pipelines required the following types of profiles:

- [Content source profiles](#content-source-profiles)
- [Text partitioning profiles](#text-partitioning-profiles)
- [Text embedding profiles](#text-embedding-profiles)
- [Indexing profiles](#indexing-profiles)

## Content source profiles

The structure of a content source profile is the following:

```json
{
    "type": "content-source-profile",
    "name": "<name>",
    "object_id": "/instances/[INSTANCE ID]/providers/FoundationaLLM.Vectorization/contentsourceprofiles/<name>",
    "description": "<description>",
    "deleted": false,
    "content_source": "<content_source>",
    "settings": {<profile_settings>},
    "configuration_references": {<profile_configuration_references>}
}
```

where:

- `<name>` is the name of the content source profile.
- `<description>` is the description of the content source profile.
- `<content_source>` is the type of the content source profile. The supported types are `AzureDataLake`, `SharePointOnline`, and `AzureSQLDatabase`.
- `<profile_settings>` is a JSON object containing the profile settings.
- `<profile_configuration_references>` is a JSON object containing the profile configuration references.

The reminder of this section describes the configuration parameters for each of the supported content source types.

### Managing content source profiles

This section describes how to manage content source profiles using the Management API.
`{{baseUrl}}` is the base URL of the Management API. `{{instanceId}}` is the unique identifier of the FLLM instance.

**Retrieve**

```
HTTP GET {{baseUrl}}/instances/{{instanceId}}/providers/FoundationaLLM.Vectorization/contentsourceprofiles
```

**Create or update**

```
HTTP POST {{baseUrl}}/instances/{{instanceId}}/providers/FoundationaLLM.Vectorization/contentsourceprofiles/<name>
Content-Type: application/json

BODY
<content source profile>
```
where `<content source profile>` is a JSON object with the structure described above.

**Delete**

```
HTTP DELETE {{baseUrl}}/instances/{{instanceId}}/providers/FoundationaLLM.Vectorization/contentsourceprofiles/<name>
```

> [!NOTE]
> FLLM implements a *logical delete* for Content Source profiles. This means that users cannot create a Content Source profile with the same name as a deleted profile. Support for purging Content Source profiles will be added in a future release.

## Text partitioning profiles

The structure of a text partitioning profile is the following:

```json
{
    "type": "text-partitioning-profile",
    "name": "<name>",
    "object_id": "/instances/[INSTANCE ID]/providers/FoundationaLLM.Vectorization/textpartitioningprofiles/<name>",
    "description": "<description>",
    "deleted": false,
    "text_splitter": "<text_splitter>",
    "settings": {<profile_settings>},
    "configuration_references": {<profile_configuration_references>}
}
```

## Additional configuration steps

### Entra ID app registration for SharePoint Online content source

Apps typically access SharePoint Online through certificates: Anyone having the certificate and its private key can use the app with the permissions granted to it.

1. Create a new **App registration** in your **Microsoft Entra ID** tenant. Next, provide a **Name** for your application and click on **Register** at the bottom of the blade.

2. Navigate to the **API Permissions** blade and click on **Add a permission** button Here you choose the permissions that you will grant to this application. Select **SharePoint** from the **Microsoft APIs** tab, then select **Application permissions** as the type of permissions required, choose the desired permissions (i.e. **Sites.Read.All**) and click on **Add permissions**. Here are the required scopes:

    - `Group.ReadWrite.All`
    - `User.ReadWrite.All`
    - `Sites.Read.All` OR `Sites.Selected`
      - `Sites.Read.All` will allow the application to read documents and list items in all site collections.
      - `Sites.Selected` will allow the application to access only a subset of site collections. The specific site collections and the permissions granted will be configured separately, in SharePoint Online.

3. The application permission requires admin consent in a tenant before it can be used. In order to do this, click on **API permissions** in the left menu again. At the bottom you will see a section **Grant consent**. Click on the **Grant admin consent for {{organization}}** button and confirm the action by clicking on the **Yes** button that appears at the top.

4. To invoke SharePoint Online with an app-only access token, you have to create and configure a **self-signed X.509 certificate**, which will be used to authenticate your application against Microsoft Entra ID. You can find additional details on how to do this in [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread#setting-up-an-azure-ad-app-for-app-only-access).

5. Next step is to register the certificate you created to this application. Click on **Certificates & secrets** blade. Next, click on the **Upload certificate** button, select the .CER file you generated earlier and click on **Add** to upload it. 

    To confirm that the certificate was successfully registered, click on **Manifest** blade and search for the `keyCredentials` property, which contains your certificate details. It should look like this:
    ```json
    "keyCredentials": [
        {
            "customKeyIdentifier": "<$base64CertHash>",
            "endDate": "yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ",
            "keyId": "<$guid>",
            "startDate": "yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ",
            "type": "AsymmetricX509Cert",
            "usage": "Verify",
            "value": "<$base64Cert>",
            "displayName": "CN=<$name of your cert>"
        }
    ]
    ```

6. Upload and store the certificate in the **KeyVault** where the FoundationaLLM Vectorization API has permissions to read **Secrets**. You will need the **Certificate Name** for the App Configuration settings listed in the table above.

    > **NOTE**
    >
    > Can I use other means besides certificates for realizing app-only access for my Azure AD app?
    >
    > **NO**, all other options are blocked by SharePoint Online and will result in an `Access Denied` message.

7. Create a new [Content Source profile using the Management API.](#content-source-profiles) Ensure that you set the necessary App Configuration settings appropriately.
