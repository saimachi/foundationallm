 Deployment type | Description | When to use
--- | --- | ---
[Quick Start](./deployment-quick-start.md) | Use your local development environment to deploy the solution to your Azure subscription. | Best suited for situations where you need the flexibility of a full development environment (e.g. to customize the solution) and you have a local development environment available.
[CloudShell]() | *Coming Soon* - Use Azure CloudShell to deploy the solution using only a browser. | Best suited for situations where you want to deploy without needing to install anything in your local development environment.
